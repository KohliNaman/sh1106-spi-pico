# sh1106-spi-pico
frankenstein driver for SH1106 OLED for the pi pico written in micropython over SPI

quick and dirty,but works. 

based off u/robert-hh and https://techatronic.com/ssd1306-raspberry-pi-pico/ mixture

will depreciate in some time and merge with robert's driver




UPDATE : tried out circuitpython and it worked with MUCH less headache so in case someone stumbles upon this in the future use circuitpython instead of micropython.
